"Yo, Cold 187. They tryin' to give you a murder rap. And you ain't even like that. Yo, serve these niggas, cause they deserve to get dissed."
(Yeah)
(Check this out)
When I sit down and write and recite for the mic I hold
Make sure my beats are loud and bold and Cold
187, that is my name, makin' it simple and plain
Here to rearrange and change
The things that I couldn't do in the past
Don't be surprised when you got a shotgun up your ass
Perpetrators, that one was just for you
I'm gonna leave ya in your seat remaining without a clue
Glued to my style like a fiend on coke
But if you say the wrong thing, I wash your mouth out with soap
Dope is not the answer
No, I'm not a Cancer
No, I'm not a hero or zero
But a Leo in stereo
And this is not a demo
K-Oss and Go Mack be cuttin' the flex tempo fast
Now I got a murder rap
Cause a brother like me said well
Yo, fingerprints ain't nothin without the murder weapon
Keep steppin'
Homicide tried to sweat, but we let 'em have it
You can see they fear through they teeth
Treat 'em like Rolaids and give 'em some relief
I feel action speaks louder than words and verbs
And adjectives, I live the life, the given gift
Not who's first, second or third
Not he said or she said or what you heard, nerd
Cause when you live like that, your life is mangled
In other words your life is all tangled up
I'm not a sucker, always go for mine
Powerlord that's hard from the start, and he will always (climb)
To the top as high as he can achieve
Sometimes that's even higher than the others believe
I'm not a doctor, not a poet, I don't have a degree
Not arrogant, egotistical, I'm the epitome
We take recon, these suckas are lying
Transform into another world as I recite these rhymes
187, he's as hard as it comes
And I don't have to brag
About the size of my gun, son
Now I got a murder rap
Cause a brother like me said well
Criminals don't use lyrics and define themselves as notorious
Brothers gotta learn hip-hop anger rages inside themselves
Your freedom will never resist to my contact K-Oss and the homie G
187 breakin' back, backbone of my group
Fat kid in my posse and I'm gettin' loose
Cause I'm takin out posses, causin' bodily harm
Makin' moves to improve as I begin to brainstorm
I'm not inferior, not takin' no crap
Last sucker tried to diss me, cold got his neck slapped
Cause power's my name, sometimes I'm insane
And if I get too mad, I have to rearrange
Your position as a MC, that's the way it should be
The way I get over, I use terminology
That's comprehensive, redemptive
That's evidently not related to the style that you hear everyday
B-boy destroyin' a toy, employin'
While the other suckers are depressed, I'm enjoyin'
What I'm doin', and ruin anyone's hope for my position
Tell em KM.G, they on a mission
They on a mission
They keep wishin you can't come off
187, you're a menace in your own mind
So take heed and proceed with caution
When he rhymes
Now I got a murder rap
Here's a murder rap to keep ya dancin'
Now I got a murder rap
Cause a brother like me said well
